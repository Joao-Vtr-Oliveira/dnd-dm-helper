# DndDmHelper

- I will create tools to help me to DM ;)

- I enjoy using [this](https://dndbattletracker.com/) website to help me in the combats, but I think it's very confuse to create and *edit*, so I'm going to create a tool that helps you to create and export, so you can use it in the other site.



## Features that I want to add:

- An easier and better way of creating and exporting battles and encounters.
- An way of creating and saving sheets.
- Saving this sheets and encounters in localStorage.
- A way of organizing playlists and sounds.
