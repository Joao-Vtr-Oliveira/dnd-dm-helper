# DndDmHelper

- I will create tools to help me to DM ;)

- I enjoy using [this](https://dndbattletracker.com/) website to help me in the combats, but I think it's very confuse to create and *edit*, so I'm going to create a tool that helps you to create and export, so you can use it in the other site.

## Change-log:
- You can create and edit encounters in a easier way.
- Now you can import & export the encounters.



## Features that I want to add:

[X] An easier and better way of creating and exporting battles and encounters.

[X] An way of creating and saving sheets.

[X] Saving this sheets and encounters in localStorage.

[] A way of organizing playlists and sounds.

[] Add the dnd API to use the bestiary for facilitate the import in the encounter builder (?).

[] Use the dnd API to check for spells and other informations.
